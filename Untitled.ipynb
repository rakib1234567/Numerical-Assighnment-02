This gives(7/3 + 5/(7/3) )/2 = 47/22 = 2.24If you keep doing this process of computing the formula, getting a result, and plugging it back in, the values will eventually get closer and closer to 5 . This method works for numbers other than 5. Write a program that asks the user for a number and uses this method to estimate the square root of the number correct to within 10^( −10) . The estimate will be correct to within 10^( −10) when the absolute value of the difference between consecutive values is less than 10^(−10) .\\n\",\n",
